# Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized by content type and confidence level to provide clear separation of concerns and transparency about what has been tested versus what remains theoretical.

## Navigation by Purpose

### 🚀 I want to solve a problem
**Start here**: [user-guides/](user-guides/) - Practical tools and implementation guides

### 🔍 I want to understand what you found  
**Go to**: [observations/](observations/) - Empirical findings and analysis results

### 🧠 I want to understand why this happens
**Go to**: [theoretical-analysis/](theoretical-analysis/) - Deep theoretical frameworks

### 🔬 I want to know how you reached conclusions
**Go to**: [methodology/](methodology/) - Research methods and approach

### ✅ I want to know what's been validated
**Go to**: [validation-status/](validation-status/) - What's tested vs theoretical

## Content Confidence Levels

### High Confidence 
- Tool functionality and basic problem existence
- Established theoretical frameworks

### Medium Confidence
- Observational patterns and correlations
- Theoretical applications to specific problems  

### Low Confidence
- Specific performance predictions
- Quantified benefits and optimal parameters

## Quick Start Paths

### For Developers with Performance Issues
1. [User Guides](user-guides/) → [Workspace Analyzer](user-guides/WORKSPACE_ANALYZER_README.md)
2. [Observations](observations/) → [Analysis Results](observations/analysis_results.md)

### For Researchers and Contributors
1. [Methodology](methodology/) → [Validation Status](validation-status/)
2. [Theoretical Analysis](theoretical-analysis/) → [Observations](observations/)

### For Understanding the Complete Picture
1. [Theoretical Analysis](theoretical-analysis/) → [Observations](observations/) → [User Guides](user-guides/)

## Transparency Principles

This documentation structure follows these principles:

1. **Clear Separation**: Facts vs theories vs tools
2. **Confidence Transparency**: What's validated vs what's theoretical
3. **Methodology Clarity**: How conclusions were reached
4. **User Focus**: Practical solutions prominently featured
5. **Honest Uncertainty**: Clear about limitations and unknowns
