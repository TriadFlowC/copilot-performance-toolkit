# Observations

This section contains empirical findings, observational data, and analysis results from testing and monitoring.

## Available Findings

### [Analysis Results](analysis_results.md)
Primary observational findings from Copilot and Git memory analysis.

**Confidence Level**: Medium - Based on monitoring data and observational patterns

### [Copilot Git Memory Hypothesis](copilot_git_memory_hypothesis.md)
Detailed hypothesis testing results about memory interactions between Copilot and Git processes.

**Confidence Level**: Medium - Observational support with theoretical backing

### [Repository Size Breakthrough](repository_size_breakthrough.md)
Findings about the relationship between repository size and performance degradation.

**Confidence Level**: Low to Medium - Based on limited observational data

### [Final Analysis and Next Steps](final_analysis_next_steps.md)
Summary of all findings and recommended next steps for validation.

**Confidence Level**: Mixed - Compilation of various confidence levels

### [Git Removal Analysis](git_removal_analysis.md)
Analysis of performance impacts when Git history is removed from repository context.

**Confidence Level**: Medium - Based on controlled testing scenarios

## Understanding Our Observations

**Important Note**: All findings in this section are based on observational data, monitoring, and theoretical analysis - **NOT formal controlled experiments**.

### Confidence Levels Used
- **High**: Validated through multiple tests and measurements
- **Medium**: Supported by observational data and theory
- **Low**: Theoretical with limited observational support
