# Methodology

This section explains how observations were made, conclusions were drawn, and the methods used in analysis.

## Research Methodology Overview

All findings in this project follow a **theoretical speculation and observational analysis** approach, as clearly stated in our [DISCLAIMER](../../DISCLAIMER.md).

### Data Collection Methods

#### 1. Performance Monitoring
- **Tools Used**: Custom Python monitoring scripts
- **Metrics Collected**: Memory usage, CPU usage, process behavior
- **Frequency**: Real-time monitoring during development sessions
- **Duration**: Multiple sessions across different repository sizes

#### 2. Behavioral Observation
- **Method**: User experience documentation during typical development workflows
- **Scenarios**: Various repository sizes, different file types, multiple workspaces
- **Documentation**: Manual recording of UI freezing, response times, memory patterns

#### 3. Theoretical Analysis
- **Approach**: Application of established computer science principles
- **Frameworks**: Information theory, computational complexity, software architecture
- **Validation**: Cross-reference with known architectural constraints

### Analysis Methods

#### Pattern Recognition
- **Memory Oscillation Analysis**: Identification of allocation/deallocation cycles
- **Performance Threshold Detection**: Finding breaking points in different scenarios
- **Behavioral Correlation**: Connecting user actions to system responses

#### Hypothesis Formation
- **Theory-Based**: Using computational complexity principles
- **Observation-Driven**: Patterns identified in monitoring data
- **Predictive Modeling**: Extrapolation from observed behaviors

#### Confidence Level Assignment
- **High**: Multiple observation sources + theoretical support
- **Medium**: Single observation source + theoretical support OR multiple observations without theory
- **Low**: Theoretical prediction without observational support

### Limitations

#### What This Methodology Does NOT Provide
- Controlled experimental conditions
- Statistical significance testing
- Peer review validation
- Reproducible experimental protocols
- Standardized measurement conditions

#### What This Methodology DOES Provide
- Real-world observational data
- Theoretical frameworks for understanding
- Practical insights for problem-solving
- Hypothesis formation for future research

### Quality Controls

#### Consistency Checks
- Cross-referencing multiple observation sessions
- Theoretical validation against established principles
- Tool accuracy verification where possible

#### Bias Mitigation
- Clear documentation of observation conditions
- Transparent reporting of limitations
- Qualification of all claims with confidence levels
