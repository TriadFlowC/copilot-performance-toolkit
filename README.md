# Copilot Performance Toolkit

A practical toolkit for monitoring and potentially improving GitHub Copilot performance in large codebases. This project provides monitoring tools, workspace analysis utilities, and theoretical reasoning about AI code assistant performance.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This toolkit contains observations and theoretical speculation, NOT formal research.** Please see [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) for important information about the academic integrity of this content.

## 🎯 Observed Problem

Many developers experience performance issues with AI code assistants in large codebases:
- **High memory usage** by VS Code in large projects
- **UI freezing** and poor responsiveness
- **Slower suggestion responses** or degraded quality
- **Performance issues** that seem to correlate with project size

This toolkit provides tools to monitor these issues and potential approaches to address them.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Memory Monitoring
Monitor VS Code memory usage and identify Copilot performance issues:
```bash
# Basic memory monitoring
python tools/test.py --mode continuous --duration 30

# Copilot-focused analysis
python tools/test.py --copilot-focused

# Detect UI freezing
python tools/test.py --mode freeze-detection

# Enable database tracking for persistent storage
python tools/test.py --db-track --copilot-analysis

# Custom database path
python tools/test.py --db-track --db-path mydata.db --snapshot
```

### 2. Database Utilities (New!)
Query, export, and manage monitoring data:
```bash
# View database statistics
python tools/db_utils.py stats

# List monitoring runs
python tools/db_utils.py list

# Export data to JSON
python tools/db_utils.py export --output results.json

# Backup database
python tools/db_utils.py backup
```

### 3. Workspace Analysis
Analyze your repository and get optimized workspace suggestions:
```bash
# Analyze current directory
python tools/workspace_analyzer_enhanced.py

# Analyze specific repository
python tools/workspace_analyzer_enhanced.py /path/to/large/repo

# Dry run (analysis only)
python tools/workspace_analyzer_enhanced.py /path/to/repo --dry-run
```

### 4. Folder Comparison
Compare two folders while respecting .gitignore patterns:
```bash
python tools/compare_folders.py /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2
```

## 🔬 Observations and Theoretical Reasoning

Based on practical experience and computer science principles:

### Common Performance Issues
- **Memory usage** appears to grow with project size
- **Response times** may slow down in larger codebases
- **UI responsiveness** can degrade with many files open

### Theoretical Analysis
- **Context management** likely becomes more complex with more files
- **Memory allocation** for tracking file relationships may grow significantly
- **Processing overhead** for analyzing large project structures increases

### Hypothesized Solution: Workspace Splitting
Based on theoretical reasoning, splitting large projects into smaller workspaces may help by:
- **Reducing scope** of files the AI needs to consider
- **Lowering memory usage** by limiting active context
- **Improving performance** through focused project boundaries

*Note: These are observations and theories, not validated research findings.*
