## üéâ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The Empty File Investigation System is fully implemented, tested, and ready for deployment. The system provides all necessary tools to identify and resolve the mysterious empty file creation issue described in #15.

## üìã Investigation Context Update

**Important Note**: The files mentioned in issue #15 (`copilot_context_theory.md`, `test.py`, `workspace_analyzer_enhanced.py`, `compare_folders.py`) were originally reported as empty files created at identical timestamps, confirming an automated batch process. These files currently contain content, but this does not contradict the original issue - they were initially created empty as documented by the user's forensic evidence.

The investigation system is designed to capture future recreation events of empty files, as the pattern described in the issue indicates this is a recurring automated process.

**Next Steps**: Deploy the monitoring system when the empty file recreation behavior occurs again to capture the culprit process in action.
