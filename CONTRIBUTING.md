# Contributing to Copilot Performance Toolkit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Copilot Performance Toolkit! This document provides guidelines for contributing improvements, reporting issues, and collaborating effectively.

## üéØ Project Philosophy

Before contributing, please understand our approach:

- **Theoretical and Observational**: This toolkit provides monitoring tools and theoretical analysis, not formal research
- **Honest Disclaimers**: All claims must align with our honest disclaimer approach (see [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md))
- **Community-Driven**: We welcome diverse perspectives and real-world feedback
- **Tool-Focused**: Contributions should primarily enhance monitoring capabilities and practical utility

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

Use our issue templates for:
- **Performance Reports**: Share your results using the toolkit
- **Bug Reports**: Report problems with the tools
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new monitoring capabilities

### 2. Contributing Code

#### Tool Improvements
We welcome contributions that improve existing tools:

**Memory Monitor (`tools/test.py`)**
- Performance optimizations
- Additional monitoring metrics
- Better error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Workspace Analyzer (`tools/workspace_analyzer_enhanced.py`)**
- Enhanced analysis algorithms
- Support for new project types
- Improved workspace boundary suggestions
- Better framework detection

**Folder Comparator (`tools/compare_folders.py`)**
- Performance improvements
- Additional comparison modes
- Better gitignore handling

#### New Monitoring Capabilities

Before proposing new tools, ensure they:
- Address genuine performance monitoring needs
- Provide practical utility for developers
- Include appropriate disclaimers about limitations
- Follow the existing code style and structure

### 3. Documentation Contributions

We welcome improvements to:
- Tool usage guides
- Theoretical explanations (with proper qualifications)
- User experience documentation
- Installation and setup instructions

## üìã Contribution Criteria

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Code follows existing style and structure
- [ ] Functions include docstrings explaining purpose and limitations
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate and informative
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility is considered

### Documentation Standards  
- [ ] Claims are properly qualified (theoretical vs. validated)
- [ ] Disclaimers align with project philosophy
- [ ] Language is observational, not research-like
- [ ] Practical examples are provided where applicable
- [ ] **Methodology sections included** for all research and analysis files

### Research and Analysis File Requirements
- [ ] **Standardized Methodology Section** using the following format:
  ```markdown
  ## Methodology
  - **Data Collection**: [Describe how data was collected]
  - **Analysis Method**: [Explain how conclusions were drawn]
  - **Limitations**: [What this doesn't prove]
  - **Confidence Level**: [High/Medium/Low]
  ```
- [ ] Methodology section placed early in document (after abstract/summary)
- [ ] All claims supported by clear methodological approach

### Tool Standards
- [ ] Tools provide genuine monitoring utility
- [ ] Limitations are clearly documented
- [ ] Performance impact of tools themselves is minimal
- [ ] Output is clear and actionable

## üî¨ Validation Process for Theoretical Claims

### Before Submitting Theoretical Analysis:

1. **Clearly Label**: Mark content as theoretical, observational, or speculative
2. **Provide Methodology**: Explain how conclusions were reached
3. **State Limitations**: What doesn't this prove or demonstrate?
4. **Confidence Level**: Rate your confidence (High/Medium/Low)
5. **Avoid Research Language**: Use observational terminology

### Example Qualification:
```markdown
## Observation: Memory Usage Patterns

**Methodology**: Monitoring VS Code processes during development sessions
**Observation**: Memory usage appears to increase with repository size
**Limitation**: No controlled experiments conducted
**Confidence**: Medium - based on consistent observations across multiple projects
**Theoretical Reasoning**: May be related to context indexing overhead
```

## üé® New Feature Evaluation Criteria

### Monitoring Capabilities
New monitoring features should:
- [ ] Address real performance pain points
- [ ] Provide actionable insights
- [ ] Have minimal performance overhead
- [ ] Work across different environments
- [ ] Include appropriate accuracy disclaimers

### Analysis Tools
New analysis capabilities should:
- [ ] Use established computer science principles
- [ ] Provide practical optimization suggestions
- [ ] Include uncertainty quantification
- [ ] Be validated against real projects
- [ ] Document assumptions and limitations

### Documentation Features
New documentation should:
- [ ] Improve user understanding or experience
- [ ] Maintain honest, qualified language
- [ ] Separate facts from theories
- [ ] Include practical examples
- [ ] Reference limitations appropriately

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Discussion First
For major features:
- Open a feature request issue
- Discuss approach and alignment with project goals
- Get feedback before implementing

### 2. Implementation
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch
- Follow existing code patterns
- Include tests if applicable
- Update documentation

### 3. Testing
- Test tools on various project types
- Verify cross-platform compatibility  
- Validate that claims match implementation
- Check performance impact

### 4. Pull Request
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Include testing details
- Reference related issues
- Provide examples of usage
